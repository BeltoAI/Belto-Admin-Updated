## 🔧 TECHNICAL CHANGES

### Files Modified:
1. **`c:\Users\dell\Desktop\belto-admin\models\AIPreference.js`**
   - Added `'youtube'` to contentType enum

2. **`c:\Users\dell\Desktop\belto-admin\lib\rag-service.js`**
   - Added ChatSession import
   - Enhanced `retrieveRelevantContent()` function
   - Updated `formatContextForPrompt()` function
   - Increased default maxResults to 5
   - Added comprehensive uploaded file content scanning

3. **`c:\Users\dell\Desktop\belto-admin\app\api\ai-proxy\route.js`**
   - Updated maxResults parameter from 3 to 5

### New Content Retrieval Logic:
```javascript
// 3. Get chat session uploaded files for this lecture
const chatSessions = await ChatSession.find({ lectureId });

if (chatSessions && chatSessions.length > 0) {
  for (const session of chatSessions) {
    if (session.messages && session.messages.length > 0) {
      for (const message of session.messages) {
        if (message.attachments && message.attachments.length > 0) {
          for (const attachment of message.attachments) {
            if (attachment.content) {
              const chunks = chunkText(attachment.content);
              
              for (const chunk of chunks) {
                const similarity = calculateTextSimilarity(query, chunk);
                if (similarity > 0.02) {
                  relevantContent.push({
                    content: chunk,
                    source: 'uploaded_file',
                    sourceInfo: {
                      lectureName: lecture?.name || 'Current Lecture',
                      fileName: attachment.name || 'Uploaded Document',
                      uploadedAt: message.timestamp || message.createdAt,
                      chatSessionId: session._id,
                      lectureId: lectureId
                    },
                    similarity: similarity,
                    type: 'uploaded_document'
                  });
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 🎯 SOLUTION OVERVIEW

### **Problem Solved:**
The RAG system was only retrieving URL-extracted content and lecture materials, but ignoring uploaded file content from chat sessions. When users uploaded documents and asked for summaries, the AI would provide irrelevant answers because it couldn't access the uploaded file content.

### **Solution Implemented:**
Enhanced the RAG service to scan all chat sessions for the current lecture, extract content from uploaded file attachments, and include this content in the context provided to the AI.

### **Data Flow:**
1. **User uploads file** → ChatSection processes via `/api/document-process`
2. **File content extracted** → Stored in `ChatSession.messages.attachments`
3. **User asks question** → AI proxy calls RAG service
4. **RAG service retrieves:**
   - Lecture materials
   - URL-extracted content  
   - **🆕 Uploaded file content** ← NEW!
5. **Enhanced context** → Provided to AI for better responses

## 🧪 TESTING

Created `test-rag.js` for comprehensive testing:
- ✅ Tests all content source integration
- ✅ Validates query processing
- ✅ Checks database connectivity
- ✅ Verifies content formatting

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

1. **Test the implementation:**
   ```bash
   node test-rag.js
   ```

2. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test user flow:**
   - Upload a document in chat
   - Ask for a summary/question about the document
   - Verify AI now includes uploaded content in responses

## 📊 EXPECTED RESULTS

**Before:** AI responses ignored uploaded files, only used URL content
**After:** AI responses include content from:
- 📚 Lecture materials  
- 🌐 URL-extracted content
- 📄 **Uploaded documents** ← Fixed!

The RAG system now provides comprehensive context from all available sources, ensuring accurate and relevant AI responses that include uploaded file content.
