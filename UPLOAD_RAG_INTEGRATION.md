# Upload and RAG Integration Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented file upload with content extraction and RAG system integration in the Edit Lecture functionality within AI Preferences.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Upload API (`/api/upload/route.js`)
- **Content Extraction**: Added support for PDF, Word documents, and plain text files
- **PDF Processing**: Uses `pdfreader` library to extract text with page-by-page processing
- **Word Processing**: Uses `mammoth` library to extract raw text from .doc/.docx files
- **Text Files**: Direct UTF-8 text extraction
- **Response Format**: Returns both `fileUrl` and `extractedContent`

### 2. Edit Lecture Modal Integration
- **File Upload**: Uses enhanced `/api/upload` endpoint
- **Content Storage**: Stores extracted content in `material.content` field
- **RAG Compatibility**: Extracted content is immediately available for RAG system

### 3. RAG System Enhancement (Already Completed)
- **Multiple Sources**: Retrieves content from lecture materials, URL-extracted content, and uploaded files
- **Content Formatting**: Properly labels sources with emojis (üìö üìÑ üåê)
- **Increased Capacity**: Supports up to 5 content chunks

## Data Flow

1. **File Upload**: User uploads file in Edit Lecture modal
2. **Content Extraction**: `/api/upload` extracts text content from file
3. **Material Storage**: File URL and extracted content saved to lecture materials
4. **RAG Integration**: Content immediately available for AI chat context
5. **Chat Enhancement**: Uploaded file content appears in AI responses

## Supported File Types

- **PDF**: `.pdf` files (using pdfreader)
- **Word Documents**: `.doc`, `.docx` files (using mammoth)
- **Text Files**: `.txt` files (direct text extraction)

## Key Features

### Content Extraction
```javascript
// Example extracted content structure
{
  fileUrl: "/uploads/1740765394019-document.pdf",
  extractedContent: "Page 1 content...\nPage 2 content...",
  message: "File uploaded successfully"
}
```

### RAG Integration
- Extracted content is stored in `Lecture.materials[].content`
- RAG service scans materials during content retrieval
- Content is formatted with üìÑ emoji in AI responses

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation for unsupported file types
- Content extraction errors don't prevent file upload
- User feedback through toast notifications

## Usage Flow

1. Navigate to AI Preferences page
2. Click "Edit Lecture" button (when lecture is selected)
3. Upload files in the Materials section
4. Files are processed and content extracted automatically
5. Save lecture to persist materials with extracted content
6. Use AI chat - uploaded content will be included in responses

## Testing

The implementation can be tested by:
1. Uploading a PDF or Word document through Edit Lecture modal
2. Checking that file appears in materials list
3. Using AI chat with content related to uploaded file
4. Verifying AI responses include uploaded file content

## Files Modified

- `/app/api/upload/route.js` - Enhanced with content extraction
- `/app/ai-preferences/components/EditLectureModal.jsx` - Already integrated
- `/lib/rag-service.js` - Already enhanced for multiple content sources
- `/models/Lecture.js` - Already supports materials with content field

## Dependencies Used

- `pdfreader` - PDF text extraction
- `mammoth` - Word document processing
- Existing file upload infrastructure
- Enhanced RAG service
