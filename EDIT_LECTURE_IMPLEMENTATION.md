## Future Enhancements Ready

### File Upload Integration with Chat Context
The Edit Lecture modal is already prepared for file upload functionality that will integrate with the chat system:

1. **File Upload Handler**: Already implemented in the modal (`handleFileUpload`)
2. **Materials Storage**: Files are stored in `formData.materials` array
3. **RAG Integration Ready**: The existing RAG service will automatically pick up new materials when:
   - Lecture is updated with new materials
   - `handleLectureUpdated` callback triggers content refresh
   - `StoredContent` component refreshes to show new materials

### Integration Points
1. **RAG Service**: Will automatically scan updated lecture materials
2. **Chat Context**: Uploaded files will be available in chat responses
3. **Content Extraction**: File content will be extracted and indexed for AI responses
